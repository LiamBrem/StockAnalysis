# StockAnalysis
A program to analyze specific stocks, view their history, and view recommendations on their performances

Functionality (What we want it to do)
---
have the user type in a stock symbol, then display information about that


To Do (short term)
---
Next Steps: have the user select a date for the stock - then maybe display a graph showing that using matplotlib

we might want to switch to the alpaca api soon

Also, it may be easier to make a new python file thats explicitly python and we can do a bunch of the API stuff there, then in main.py we can do all the flask stuff?

Maybe we could make a web scraper that scrapes some website and finds some stocks that are possibly doing good and then analyze them & buy them.
